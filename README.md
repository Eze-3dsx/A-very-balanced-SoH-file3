# A-very-balanced-SoH-file3
A very balanced SoH file3 (9000 hearts, biggoron sword as child, and basically having everything you should NOT have for a file with not even kokiri forest open)

i think it only works on SoH (Ship of Harkinian, download here: https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright/releases/tag/9.0.2 , youll also need an european debug OOT rom)

its set up as a randomizer btw, remember that you must have opened your soh oot atleast once for a file named "saves" to appear, when that file appears, just drag the file3.sav into the saves folder, and it should appear in File 3 as a randomizer

oh i almost forgot to say, the file is named "LA-Eze", sry abt that
